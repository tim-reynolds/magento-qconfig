Magento Quick Config Module
===========================

I created this module to make working in the System -> Configuration area of the Magento Admin easier for my clients. With qsearch you get a text box that will search the labels and values of fields for any that match your input. Areas that don't match will be shaded out, allowing you to quickly and accurately navigate the configuration area. Simple, but effective.

Installation
------------

Clone the repository down to your computer. Copy the contents of the src/ directory into your Magento root directory. Then go into the admin and clear the config and layout caches.

This has been tested in Community 1.7 and Enterprise 1.12. If you have any issues please reach out, though as stated in the license this comes with no warranty. Please test in development before pushing to production!

TODO
----

There is no support yet for single/multi-select inputs that have a source model. I have worked on a few attempts at this, however I don't yet have a solution I am comfortable with. If you search for "enabled" you won't find much, as the actual value is "1" in the data. Additionally, searches for the Country/Region/Locale text names won't work, but if you search for the short-code it will (en_us vs United States).

Shameless Plug
--------------

I hope you enjoy this module. I have a few other modules I want to give back to the community. If you enjoy this, and need any help on a commercial project please don't hesitate to reach out. I can be contacted at Reynolds.TimJ@gmail.com or on Twitter @razialx.

Motivation and Thanks
---------------------

As the Magento community has been amazing to me, I decided to give this back as some small token of appreciation. I have long wanted to write this, but was always busy. The final motivation came when Alan Storm (@alanstorm, http://alanstorm.com) released an excellent module for quickly navigating the Admin menu with your keyboard. You should also buy his e-book on Magento Layouts. I also want to thank other great community members (and forgive me, I will surely forget many): @VinaiKopp @fbrnc @sherrierohde @sparcksoft @kab8609 @benmarks @markshust @monocat @arush @b_ike @colinmollenhour @alistairstead @aschroder @cloudhead @zerkella @s3lf and many many more. Thanks for making this the best software community around!
